# Handoff: taking Swarm Derby live with the IMD swarm

**Current assignment:** deploy only DerbyAuction for the existing SwarmDerby v2 at
`0x53d9aa0b925c5148bcc5f98f394872687f4c831c`. Follow the current `ADAPTATION.md`
handoff and `DEPLOY.md`'s Auction section. The game-launch checklist below is historical
and does not authorize another game deployment, site publication or bonus transaction.

For the swarm agent (and its operator). Work top to bottom; each step says what to check
before moving on. Long request bodies live in `DEPLOY.md`.

## Before you start

**Decisions that belong to the owner, not the agent:**

1. Which wallet owns the contract (`owner` in the launch). Only it can change prices (never
   below 0.01 IMD a turn), withdraw the 5% ops share, change the house key with 2 days'
   notice and transfer ownership. It can't move pots or vaults, but the holder of the house
   key can compute every draw, so the key holder must not play.
2. That paid entry + prize pool is allowed where the game will be offered.

**Two different IMD tokens:**

| | Chain | Address | Used for |
|---|---|---|---|
| Paying the swarm | Ethereum mainnet | `0xd34a99bc0f67ae1bbd63c660e6d0b0dd03e263b7` | audit, launch, hosting (x402 + Permit2) |
| The game | Robinhood Chain | `0x5F7Bb59365ce557C26dbcAa4EE9d39A4b95B7127` | turns, pots, burns |

**Never** put a private key, seed or salt in a repo, a job objective or an upload. Everything
sent to IMD is public.

**Budget for the swarm work:** audit 0.5 + launch 0.5 + hosting 0.5, all in Ethereum-mainnet
IMD, plus Robinhood ETH for gas and a little Robinhood IMD for the smoke test. Daily payouts
need no IMD services: they come from the contract's own scoreboards.

## 1. Publish the code

Create two **public** GitHub repos from the two folders:

- `swarm-derby-contracts` (Foundry repo at the root)
- `swarm-derby-site` (static site at the root)

Check: `forge test` passes (117), and `python3 build.py game.html ../index.html`, run in the
site repo's `dev/` folder, reproduces `index.html` exactly.

## 2. Readiness check (free)

```
node imd-check.mjs
```

Continue only if Robinhood Chain (4663) is open for launches with `evm_contracts`.

## 3. Audit (0.5 IMD)

```
POST /requests/import  {"url": "https://github.com/OWNER/swarm-derby-contracts", "kind": "contracts"}
```

Then `job.open` with:

```json
{
  "objective": "Audit SwarmDerby (src/SwarmDerby.sol, src/DerbyOdds.sol): IMD turn purchases and the 40/45/10/5 split into per-day pots, commit-reveal swings decided by a house draw (src/HouseDraw.sol: a 2048-bit RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 SHA-256 signature over drawMessage, checked with the modexp precompile; refund when no draw comes within DRAW_WINDOW; foul when a drawn swing is not revealed in time), EIP-712 session-key consent, the 20-swing arcade cap, the on-chain top-10 boards, slam vault payouts, and settleNextDay's in-order daily payout math and rollover.",
  "template": "audit",
  "repoUrl": "https://github.com/OWNER/swarm-derby-contracts",
  "baseCommit": "COMMIT_FROM_IMPORT"
}
```

Read the report at `GET /jobs/:id/report.md`. Fix critical and high findings, rerun
`forge test` and the `e2e/` rehearsal,
push, and re-audit if the changes were large.
Any change to `DerbyOdds.sol` must be mirrored in the site's odds engine; the parity test
catches drift.

## 4. Deploy (0.5 IMD)

Import the audited commit again, dry-run with `POST /requests/check`, then `launch.open`
with the body in `DEPLOY.md` step 3 (`onchain: "evm_contracts"`, `chainId: 4663`, owner
from "Before you start", no token).

**Read the adapt step's diff** before the launch goes live. Afterwards check on
`https://robinhoodchain.blockscout.com`:

- `owner()` is the chosen wallet; `imd()` is the Robinhood IMD address
- `houseKey()` is the house service's modulus, and `pendingHouseKeyAt()` is 0
- the house service draws a test swing within a few seconds
- `singlePrice()` = 0.15e18, `packPrice()` = 0.5e18, `ARCADE_DAILY_CAP()` = 20

## 5. Point the site at the contract

In the site repo: set `DERBY_CONFIG.networks.robinhood.derby` in `dev/game.html`, rebuild
`index.html`, replace `SWARM_DERBY_ADDRESS` in `agent.md`, commit, push.

## 6. Host the site (0.5 IMD)

```
POST /requests/import  {"url": "https://github.com/OWNER/swarm-derby-site", "kind": "site"}
```

Then `job.open` with an `import-site` step before the check. The IMD docs require
`import-site` only when the import reports `site.build: true` (this repo reports `false`), but
a job with only a `site-content-check` step wrote no files, so IMD had nothing to publish and
the site stayed queued ("the job produced no artifact to publish"). Keep both steps.

```json
{
  "objective": "Host the Swarm Derby static site. No build: copy exactly index.html, agent.md, agent-bot.mjs, LICENSE and NOTICES.md from the repository root into dist/, byte for byte. Do not put dev/ or README.md in dist/ and do not edit any file.",
  "repoUrl": "https://github.com/OWNER/swarm-derby-site",
  "baseCommit": "COMMIT_FROM_IMPORT",
  "shape": "chain",
  "steps": [{ "skill": "import-site" }, { "skill": "site-content-check" }],
  "ipfs": "swarm-derby",
  "github": false,
  "acceptanceCriteria": ["dist/ holds exactly the five files above, each byte-identical to the root file."]
}
```

Check: `GET /sites/by-label/swarm-derby` returns the new CID, and
`https://swarm-derby.site.identitymd.eth.limo` (ENS) or `https://swarm-derby.sites.imd.fun`
(IMD's sites gateway, same CID) loads the game with practice mode working and the leaderboard
showing the live board.

## 7. Smoke test with small amounts

On the hosted site, with a fresh wallet holding ~1 Robinhood IMD and a little ETH:

1. Practice mode plays with no wallet.
2. Connect, switch to Live, buy a single try (0.15 IMD): 40% shows up at `0x…dEaD`.
3. Enable quick swings (one wallet signature binds the browser key), swing a few times: no
   wallet popups, the arcade board updates.
4. Run the agent bot with `MAX_IMD=0.5`: it appears on the Agents tab.

## 8. First payout (the next day)

After 00:10 UTC (the last draws and reveals take up to 10 minutes), open the leaderboard: "Pay the winners" appears for each league with a
finished day. Press it (or call `settleNextDay(league)` from code). Check the winners and the
tip on the explorer, and that the button moves on to the next open day or disappears.

## 9. After launch

- `withdrawOps` releases the 5% ops share (Robinhood IMD).
- Once things are stable, move `owner` to a multisig: `transferOwnership(multisig)`, then the
  multisig calls `acceptOwnership()`. Ownership cannot be renounced.
- Site updates: change the files (for the game, `dev/game.html`, then rebuild), commit and
  push. Do not rerun step 6: a new `job.open` starts a new project, and IMD hosts it under a
  suffixed name (`swarm-derby-<4 hex>`), not under `swarm-derby`. To keep the name, send a
  `job.continue` with `parentJobId` = the hosting project's newest job (`project.head` on
  `GET /jobs/:id`) and `"ipfs": true`. It refuses `repoUrl` and `baseCommit`, so give it a
  `refine-project` step whose `paths` are the changed files and whose objective replaces each
  one with its raw GitHub file at the pushed commit, byte for byte, with a sha256 acceptance
  criterion. Then add the `import-site` and `site-content-check` steps as in step 6. Only the
  wallet that paid the hosting job can pay. Dry-run with `POST /requests/check` first.
